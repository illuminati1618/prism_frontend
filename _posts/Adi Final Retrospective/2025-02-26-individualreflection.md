# What's Next in ...

## CompSci?
 - Keep learning
 - Take CSA to continue my learning. These classes have really pushed me to my limits (since my grade is always at the edge) and while it is difficult at times it helps me learn and accomplish a lot.

## Internship?
 - Goal is to get one for next summer/school year
 - May look good to colleges, but more importantly it will help me deeply learn about what it is like to work in the CS industry. 

## Interests?
 - I want to bring my interest and skills with AI into the CSP/CSA classroom because I feel that it will allow me to make a connection between my skill set and CSP class. It will also push me to make my AI models accurate while using as little system resources as possible because the models will likely be run locally. 

## Career? 
 - Still undecided
 - Most likely a field related to computer science/software engineering
