# My Plans for Computer Science

## Reflecting on My Journey

As I continue developing my skills in computer science, I’ve taken the time to reflect on both my strengths and areas for growth. Over the years, I’ve gained a strong grasp of programming, problem-solving, and developing innovative features like my **Code Palette** and **Leaderboard**. However, collaboration, refining user experience, and balancing efficiency with complexity are areas where I see room for improvement.

## Strengths & Weaknesses in Collaboration

Collaboration plays a massive role in the success of any project. Through various experiences, I’ve recognized some key aspects of my teamwork skills:

### **Strengths:**

- **Idea Generation:** I excel at coming up with unique solutions and implementing creative features.
- **Independence:** I can work efficiently on my own, ensuring progress even when team input is minimal.
- **Technical Problem-Solving:** When faced with bugs or design flaws, I enjoy debugging and optimizing code.
- **Blog/Issue Creation** I can create flawless blogs and issues, making use of it while working as a team.

### **Areas for Improvement:**

- **Incorporating Team Feedback:** While I value feedback, I sometimes focus too much on my original vision rather than adapting it based on others’ input. 
- **Balancing Collaboration & Efficiency:** While teamwork fosters creativity, I need to work on making collaboration smoother without slowing down the development process. 

## My Plan for the Future in Computer Science

Looking ahead, I want to deepen my knowledge in software development, AI, and cybersecurity while also refining my ability to collaborate effectively. My goal is to develop projects that combine innovation with user-friendliness, making technology more accessible and impactful.

### **Future Goals:**

- **Improve Collaboration:** Work on better integrating team feedback and finding ways to efficiently divide responsibilities in group projects.

## Taking AP CSA

As I look to the future, I have decided to take **AP Computer Science A** because I truly enjoyed this class. The freedom it provides for creativity and problem-solving makes it an exciting challenge, and I want to continue expanding my knowledge in Java and object-oriented programming. I believe this course will help refine my coding skills and prepare me for more advanced software development projects.

## Final Thoughts

Computer science is a field that constantly evolves, and I’m excited to grow alongside it. By refining my strengths, addressing my weaknesses, and focusing on impactful projects, I aim to contribute to the future of technology in meaningful ways. Through continuous learning, collaboration, and innovation, I hope to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the digital world.
