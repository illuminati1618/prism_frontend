## Summary: Why I Deserve a 0.92/1

This trimester has been filled with ups and downs, but I have made significant progress. Before this trimester, I had little experience with Flask, AWS, or full-stack deployment, but I have since developed these skills and applied them to my work. My commit analytics show my steady contributions, even when I was in India, demonstrating dedication and consistency. While there is always room for improvement, I have been a strong team member, contributed meaningful features, and maintained a productive work ethic. For these reasons, I believe I deserve a **0.92/1** on this retrospective self-grade.
