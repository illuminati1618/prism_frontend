title: Manas's Practice Review Reflection
categories: [Manas Final Retrospective]

I recently presented my final project demo in two practice sessions—one with Ms. Pataki and another with Lalita Narayan who is in Period 4. Both sessions provided valuable insights, but it was Lalita’s feedback that highlighted some key areas for improvement.

While my demo showcased the project’s potential, I noticed that my technical explanations sometimes strayed into less detail. This tendency to wander off-topic made parts of the presentation less accessible to those with a technical background. Recognizing this weakness, I’ve been actively refining my delivery by tightening my narrative, focusing on core concepts, and practicing time management.

Below is the peer grading rubric provided by Lalita Narayan for my final demo presentation:

| Category                 | Maximum Points | Description                                                                                                                      | Score |

| **Technical Explanation**| 2              | Technical details are explained in a way that is accessible without overwhelming the audience.                                   | 1.9   |
| **Engagement & Q&A**     | 1              | The presentation maintained audience engagement and addressed questions confidently.                                           | 1.0   |
| **Reflective Analysis**  | 2              | Demonstrates honest self-reflection on strengths and weaknesses, with clear steps outlined for future improvement.                | 1.7   |
| **Total**                | 10             | Overall performance score.                                                                                                       | 9.1   |

The feedback has not only boosted my confidence but also steered me towards a more focused and effective presentation style. I’m committed to addressing these weaknesses and enhancing my communication skills, ensuring that future demos are both engaging and succinct. I also now feel more
