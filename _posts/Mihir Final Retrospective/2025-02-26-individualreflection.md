# Strengths, Weaknesses, and Self Grading for Mihir Bapat - Trimester 2

This is a reflection of a culmination of everything I have done in trimester 2, and my thoughts on looking ahead in my future as a computer scientist.

## Preface
This trimester has been filled with a BUNCH of ups and downs. 

I won't lie. I have learned QUITE a lot. Before the start of this trimester, I didn't have much experience with Flask, Deployment, AWS, and much of Frontend to Backend Deployment. 

Now, I am fluently able to not only code using these technologies, but also am able to explain my workings to my fellow peers.

This learning has shown in not only my work this trimester, but also the fact that I was able to start the CS Tutoring Club this trimster, where in our first month, have already helped numerous people through countless individual and group sessions.


## Self Grade on Individual Hard and Soft Skills - Strengths and Weaknesses

| Category                                    | Max Points | Self Grade | Explanation |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Learning & Skill Growth            | 0.25          | 0.24        | In this trimester, I learned how to use various technologies such as Flask, deploy on AWS, and integrate from frontend to backend. As one of the deployment admins, I primarily interacted with the cockpit server and began to understand how sites like google, or github, are actually hosted on the internet. |
| Commit Analytics     | 0.25          | 0.24        | I averaged about 1-2 large commits per day, which I think shows steady progress. I was one of the leading contributors, and I think I worked well as a team and individually. |
| Work Ethic & Collaboration | 0.25          | 0.21        | I helped classmates during office hours, lunch, and outside of school with CSP. I also started the CS Tutoring Club this trimster, from which we have already helped a lot of people and want to continue doing so. However, I do think I could have made better use of my class time. |
| Areas for Improvement                         | 0.25          | 0.21        | I need to work on staying lazer focused during CSP and be more productive. Yet I still think I was amongst the most productive from a more hollistic trimester view.  |
| Overall Score                           | 1         | 0.90    |  |


My commit analytics is also there to attest to my frequency of commits, and how many lines of code I have written/removed. As shown, I am one of the top contributors in my group.

| **Frontend**  | **Backend** |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| ![Frontend Contributions]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mihir/frontend.png)                   |   ![Backend Contributions]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mihir/backend.png)       |

As of Sunday, March 2 at 2:20 AM, I am the leading contributor in the frontend, and 3rd highest in the backend with one of the most amount of lines added into our repository.

In total, I have committed over 90 times this trimester. Removing some of the one liner fix commits and averaging that out over 60 - 5 days of finals week, even including days I was sick/absent, this equates to about 1-2 commits per day. I think this is extremely steady and progressive work.

My work has been good this trimester, however, there are definitely things to improve on.

Other than the one occasion where I was off task, I truly do believe that I was a good student in class. Not only was I able to help a lot of my fellow classmates in not only this period and other periods during non school time, but I was also able to add a feature for all of my group members.

## Future Steps

I have decided that I want to major in Computer Science in College. For this, I have a number of things lined up in high school to do, whether that be coursework or extracurricular activities.

For starters, I will be taking AP CSA next year. I want to learn more about the whole AGILE development, and quite frankly was hooked by the CSA project at N@TM.

Extra curricular wise, to further deepen my understanding and passion of Computer Science, I plan (and already have) on applying to various summer programs, including COSMOS. 

I already participate in hackathons with friends, and I hope to continue creating AI based full stack projects to help my community.

I also plan on reaching out to industry professionals. With the plethora of material and retrospective material here, I think I could be able to find an internship in computer science as well.

I also plan on building a portfolio website to showcase all of my projects. I want to get it Mr. Mortensen before I deploy it.

Overall, I think this has been an extremely successful trimester not only because I have gained experience into using advanced technologies, but also because I learned a lot about AGILE methodology and how to work as a team.


| Category                                    | Max Points | Self Grade | Explanation |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| 5 Things Done Over 12 Weeks            | 5          | 4.65        | I think I deserve a 4.6/5 on the 5 things done over 12 weeks because I have effectively and thoroughly explained my 5 features. These were not simple features, and required a lot of time, hard work, and dedication.|
| Full Stack Project Demo & Feedback     | 2          | 1.72        | I was able to present my work at N@TM, and incorporate some feedback from the fair into my own work.  |
| Project Feature Blog (CPT/FRQ Language) | 1          | 0.90        | I centered my feature blog around CPT requirements. I went step by step explaining how my project meets each step of the CPT requirements. I think this is crucial for the FRQ part of the AP exam if I want to get a good score. |
| MCQ Completion                         | 1          | 0.90        | As I have mentioned in the blog, I got a score of 62/67 in 1:37 mins, which I thought was excellent. I reflected on what I got wrong and created an action plan to improve, which will come in handy while studying for the test. |
| Retrospective & Reflection              | 1          | 0.88       | I reflected on the strengths and weaknesses of both my project and as an individual in CSP and on my future in computer science. Not only did I send a detailed summary of my talk to Mr. Mortensen more than 24 hours prior to the deadline, but as a group we also met with Ms. Pataki, and as an individual I met with Aadi Bhat to discuss improvements. |
| Overall Score                           | 10         | 9.0    | From the bottom of my heart, I think I deserve a 9.0/10 in this retrospective because of the sheer time, effort, and quality of work I have produced and made. I efficiently reflect on my successes, weaknesses, and improvements as a group and individually in this class.  |
