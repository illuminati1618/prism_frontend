title: Mihir's Practice Review Reflection
categories: [Mihir Final Retrospective]
---

I partook in two practice final reviews, one from Ms. Pataki, and from Aadi Bhat in Period 1. I think doing these practice reviews were helpful because it helped me udnerstand what it would be like for a person who has no context on my project understand what it is about.

These reviews made me reflect on how I was presenting things. Sometimes, I went on random tangents explaining code and features that only made sense to me. 

Taking part in these reviews helped me refine what I am saying, shorten my time, and make my presentation more effective. I was advised to cut the random parts out and stick to the point, which helped me increase the efficiency of my review too.

It also shows that I am taking genuine interest within this final and displaying passion, as I genuinely want to succeed in not only this class, but in life.

I think that being able to explain my work to coworkers is a highly useful skill in any industry, and I think this final has taught me how to do just that.

As a percentage, the lowest grade was in the full stack project demo, which was probably because I went on random tangents. Taking Aadi's advice in mind, I will update the way I present during the final in order to ensure this score goes higher.

Overall, he thought I was pretty deep and reflective in my work over this trimester.
