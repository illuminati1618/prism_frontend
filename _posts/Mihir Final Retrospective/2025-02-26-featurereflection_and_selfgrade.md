This trimester has been filled with a BUNCH of ups and downs. 

I won't lie. I have learned QUITE a lot. Before the start of this trimester, I didn't have much experience with Flask, Deployment, AWS, and much of Frontend to Backend Deployment. 

This learning has shown in not only my work this trimester, but also the fact that I was able to start the CS Tutoring Club this trimster, where in our first month, have already helped numerous people through countless individual and group sessions.

My commit analytics is also there to attest to my frequency of commits, and how many lines of code I have written/removed. As shown, I am one of the top contributors in my group.

| **Frontend**  | **Backend** |

As of Sunday, March 2 at 2:20 AM, I am the leading contributor in the frontend, and 3rd highest in the backend with one of the most amount of lines added into our repository.

In total, I have committed over 90 times this trimester. Removing some of the one liner fix commits and averaging that out over 60 - 5 days of finals week, even including days I was sick/absent, this equates to about 1-2 commits per day. I think this is extremely steady and progressive work.

My work has been good this trimester, however, there are definitely things to improve on.

Other than the one occasion where I was off task, I truly do believe that I was a good student in class. Not only was I able to help a lot of my fellow classmates in not only this period and other periods during non school time, but I was also able to add a feature for all of my group members.

For these reasons, I think I deserve a **0.90/1** on this retrospection.
