# 2020 Practice Exam 1 MCQ Blog/Reflection

My score on this MCQ was a 62/67.

I tried to take this test like it was the actual AP test. That means not consulting any external sources, like my friends, when stuck.

I ended up spending 1 hour 37 minutes on this test. Considering the MCQ section of the AP test is 2 hours, and the increased stress/pressure that comes with the AP test, I am extremely happy with my score and time.

But, there's always room to improve. Below are a list of topics with respect to the number of questions on the test, and a percentage of my performance.
