## **One Specific Project To Comment On**


One cool site I noticed during N@TM was Neptune:

Neptune is a website which allows students access to certain tools based around education which helps them throughout day to day life.

- Profiles - Students can select profile pictures, theme colors which allows them to customize their profile and create a unique profile that that fits their taste
- Chatrooms: Using socket.io, Neptune allows students to chat with each other live like imessage or instagram. Students can ask other students about school, classes, help, and more related to school.
- AI Chatbot: Neptune uses Gemini to allow students to ask homework based questions.
- Class Selection System: Students can select and view their classes with a built in timer to help students organize and manage their time with ease

---

On the other hand, some suggestions I had, which I told them about were:

- "One thing you could add is maybe more chatrooms about certain broad subjects like math or science so if a student asks about certain questions to needs help on a certain subject, the chatroom wouldn't get cluttered with a bunch of subjects and people"
- "The UI could be more consistent throughout the entire website"

---

In the end, I told them that their features were very helpful and had amazing purpose, but the UI could be more consistent throughout the entire website (mostly the chatroom and class list table)

Overall, Neptune's project is really cool, functional, and useful.
