# PPR Code Snippets

A PPR is created to assist in responding to the written response prompts on exam day. The goal of the PPR is to submit required portions of your code by capturing and pasting program code segments you developed during the administration of this task.


PPR Submission Requirements:
- Your code segments should not include any comments. 
- Screen captures should not be blurry.
- Text should be at least 10-point font size.

PPR Snippet Requirements:
- Two Procedure "Program Codes"
  - The first program code segment must be a student-developed procedure that:
    - Defines the procedureâ€™s name and return type (if necessary)
    - Contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect on the functionality of the procedure
    - Implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration
  - The second program code segment must show where your student-developed procedure is being called in your program.
- Two List "Program Codes"
 - The first program code segment must show how data have been stored in the list.
 - The second program code segment must show the data in the same list being used.


## Prodecure Program Code 1

Explaination:
- **Procedure:** Called "restore"
- **Return type:** List - List of restored Vote objects.
- **Parameter:** Data (list) - List of dictionaries containing vote data.
- **Sequencing:** First defines an empty dictionary for restored classes. Then, iterates through votes to determine if it is already existing. Then, if it already exists, it will fix inconsistences. Otherwise, it will add the vote. 
- **Selection:** If a vote already exists, it updates the record instead of creating duplicates. SELECTS only erased votes using a `if` statement.
- **Iteration:** The function iterates over database queries to maintain vote consistency. ITERATES using an `for`, ensuring that every vote is properly handled and updated as necessary.

## Procedure Program Code 2

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pics/image1.png)

Explaination: 
- This procedure is called when the user wants to restore data. It will accept the vote data as an argument and procede. 

## List Program Code 1

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pics/image2.png)

Explaination: 
- The `upvotes` and `downvotes` lists are populated by filtering all votes based on their type.
- Each vote's data is added to the corresponding list using list comprehension.

## List Program Code 2

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pics/image3.png)

Explaination:
- Upvotes List: Iterates over each vote in `data.upvotes` and pushes the post_id (converted to an integer) into the `voteData.upvotes` list.
- Downvotes List: Iterates over each vote in `data.downvotes` and pushes the post_id (converted to an integer) into the `voteData.downvotes` list.
