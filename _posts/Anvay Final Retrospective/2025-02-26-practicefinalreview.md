# Prepping the Final

### **Final Presentation Practice with Ansh Kumar: Reflections & Suggestions**  

As the final presentation approached, Ansh Kumar and I decided to practice together to refine our delivery and ensure we could hit all 10 points effectively. We each took turns presenting our work over the past 12 weeks, discussing our full-stack projects, and analyzing our retrospectives.

#### **My Feedback to Ansh Kumar:**  
- **Clarity & Structure:** I suggested that Ansh make his responses more structured, especially when covering the five major things he worked on over the 12 weeks. Listing them in a clear timeline with issues and resolutions would make his explanation more effective.  
- **CPT Requirement Highlights:** His full-stack project was strong, but I pointed out that he could better emphasize the **CPT (Create Performance Task) requirements**, ensuring he explicitly connects project features to College Board expectations.  
- **Impressing in Reflection:** I encouraged him to personalize his retrospective by discussing how his strengths and weaknesses evolved throughout the project. Instead of just listing next steps, I suggested he connect them to future classes, internships, or even cybersecurity interests.  
- **N@tM Feedback:** While he had received good comments, I recommended that he highlight specific feedback that shaped his next steps rather than just summarizing reactions.  
- **Live Review Strategy:** Since time is limited, I advised him to make his presentation more dynamic by using bullet points in his notes and focusing on concise, impactful statements.  

#### **Ansh’s Feedback to Me:**  
- **Burndown Chart Explanation:** Ansh noticed that I mentioned my burndown chart but didn’t fully explain how my team used it to track progress. He suggested I provide an example of how we adapted our timeline based on obstacles.  
- **Flow:** He recommended that I explicitly connect my **project feature blog write-up** to **CPT/FRQ-style** language so that my reflections would align better.  
- **Engaging with Other Projects:** He encouraged me to bring up my interests in other projects from N@tM, mentioning what I learned from them or how they inspired potential improvements in my own project.  
- **Retrospective Depth:** He pointed out that while I covered my strengths, I could improve my reflection by discussing a specific technical weakness I overcame and how I plan to continue improving it in future courses.  

#### **Next Steps:**  
Practicing with Ansh helped me refine my approach for the final. I’ll make sure to:  
- Strengthen my retrospective by linking weaknesses to clear next steps.  
- Improve my burndown checklist explanation.
- Emphasize CPT alignment in my project blog write-up.  
- Be more intentional about incorporating feedback from N@tM into my future plans.
