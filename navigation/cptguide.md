## Overview
The **Create Performance Task (CPT)** is an AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) project designed to evaluate programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and computational thinking. The project requires the development of a **functional program** and documentation that demonstrates understanding of key programming concepts.

The submission includes:
- **Program Code** (developed independently or collaboratively)
- **Video Demonstration** (created independently)
- **Personalized Project Reference** (created independently)

A minimum of **9 hours of class time** is allocated for completion.

---

## Project Requirements
Each project must include:
1. **User Input Handling**: The program must accept input from one of the following sources:
   - User interactions (e.g., button clicks, text input)
   - Sensors or device inputs
   - Online data streams
   - File-based data

2. **List or Collection Usage**: A list (or other collection type) must be used to manage data and simplify program complexity.

3. **Student-Developed Procedure**:
   - Must have a **defined name** and **return type** (if applicable).
   - Must use at least **one parameter** that affects functionality.
   - Must include an **algorithm** with sequencing, selection, and iteration.

4. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Must demonstrate **sequencing (step-by-step execution)**.
   - Must include **selection (if-statements, switches, or conditions)**.
   - Must include **iteration (loops like for, while, or recursion)**.

5. **Program Output**: The program must provide **tactile, audible, visual, or textual output** based on user interaction or data processing.

6. **Commenting and Acknowledgment**:
   - Comments should be used to describe functionality.
   - Any external code or AI-generated assistance must be acknowledged in comments.

## Planning the Project
Before coding, a structured plan should be developed:

### **1. Identifying the Purpose**
- Determine the **problem** being solved or the **interest** being explored.
- Consider whether the program is a **game, calculator, data analysis tool, or interactive application**.

### **2. Writing a Problem Statement**
Example Template:
```markdown
## Problem Statement
This program aims to [describe the problem or goal]. It will allow users to [describe user interaction] and will provide [describe expected output].
```

### **3. Designing the Program Flow**
A **flowchart** or **pseudocode** can be used to visualize logic before implementation.

Example Pseudocode:
```python
START
  Get user input
  Process input using a function
  Store data in a list
  Apply conditions and loops
  Display output
END
```

---

## Developing the Program
When implementing the program, the following aspects should be considered:

### **1. Structuring the Code**
Organize the code into:
- **Main program logic**
- **Functions/procedures**
- **Data handling (lists, dictionaries)**
- **User interaction (input/output handling)**

### **2. Example Program Structure**
```python
# Define a function with a parameter
def calculate_average(grades):
    total = sum(grades)
    return total / len(grades)

# Main program
student_grades = [90, 85, 78, 92]
average = calculate_average(student_grades)
print(f"Student's average grade: {average}")
```

### **3. Testing and Debugging**
- Test the program with **various inputs**.
- Implement **error handling** (e.g., try-except blocks in Python).
- Use **print statements** for debugging.

---

## Documenting the Code
**Comments and explanations** are crucial for readability. The following practices should be followed:

### **1. Using Descriptive Comments**
```python
# Function to calculate the average of a list of numbers
def calculate_average(grades):
    total = sum(grades)  # Sum all elements in the list
    return total / len(grades)  # Divide by the number of elements
```

### **2. Acknowledging External Sources**
If AI assistance, open-source code, or external APIs were used, include:
```python
# This function was adapted from an open-source project on GitHub:
# Source: https://github.com/example/source
```

---

## Creating the Video
The video should demonstrate:
- **Input interaction**
- **At least one functional feature**
- **Output generated by the program**

### **Video Requirements**
- **Duration**: Max **1 minute**
- **File Format**: `.webm, .mp4, .wmv, .avi, .mov`
- **Size**: Max **30MB**
- **No voice narration** (text captions are recommended)

**Tip**: Use a screen recording tool such as **OBS Studio, ScreenPal, or Screencastify** to capture the demonstration.

---

## Writing the Personalized Project Reference
This reference will be available on **exam day** to support written responses. It includes:

1. **Two Code Segments**
   - A **student-developed procedure** (with sequencing, selection, and iteration).
   - The **location where the procedure is called**.

2. **List Usage**
   - One segment showing **list creation and storage**.
   - One segment demonstrating **list usage (modifying or accessing elements).**

---

## Final Submission Checklist
Before submitting, ensure the following components are finalized:

- [ ] **Program Code** (saved as a PDF)
- [ ] **Video Demonstration** (max 1 minute)
- [ ] **Personalized Project Reference** (two code segments)
- [ ] **Adherence to Plagiarism Policy**
- [ ] **Submission to AP Digital Portfolio**

**Note**: Once submitted as final, revisions cannot be made.
